This is the fleet's one **destructive** routine command. It rewrites generated surfaces across every
repo from authored state. Run it with a stale binary and it rewrites them in an **older format** —
that is a silent regression, not an error.

The same warning applies to anything that ends in it: `./scripts/validate_brain.sh` and
`scripts/routine.sh` both call an `emit-state --write`.

## Step 1 — Rebuild first. This is not optional.

```bash
mev conformance --check toolchain-freshness
```

Drifted output names the two commits and says *"rebuild before any --write run"*. Then:

```bash
cargo install --path core/mev
cargo install --path core/bastion    # bastion embeds mev as a path lib — a stale bastion carries a stale mev
```

**Why this matters more than it sounds.** Running `emit-state --write` from a stale binary has
already reverted the generated Attention lanes in two `status.md` files to an older format; both had
to be restored with `git checkout` (`base-template:installed-mev-and-bastion-are-stale`).

**The non-obvious rule behind it — on this machine the install, not the merge or the push, is the
delivery boundary.** A block can be `closed`, merged to local main, and still deliver nothing
(`mev:closed-but-uninstalled-reads-as-delivered-downstream`): `emit-state` cleared the closed block's
edges so a downstream board showed work as startable, while the installed binaries predated it,
`mev lanes` exited 2, and the lane JSON files did not exist on disk. Every `emit-state` run that day
used the stale binary, so the planners never ran.

**And the install trigger misses locally-authored work.** `~/.cargo/bin/mev` is a real installed copy
that only refreshes on an explicit `cargo install`; the build script runs it only when a *pull*
brought new commits — so the machine that **authors** commits never trips it and silently drifts,
while the Mac Mini self-heals on its next cron pull
(`mev:mev-install-trigger-misses-locally-authored-commits`). The pre-push advisory is non-blocking.
Manual fix: `cargo install --path core/mev --force`.

## Step 2 — Check the embargo

While any **measurement** block is live, `syn refresh` / `syn ingest` / `syn prune` /
`emit-state --write` / `routine.sh` / `validate_brain.sh` are **banned** — corpus changes invalidate
a retrieval measurement in flight. The embargo is declared in `planning/close-the-loop/roadmap.md`
and `lane-substrate.txt`. Check the orchestrator's status before writing; if a measurement chain is
running, use read-only `bastion validate-brain --<flag>` instead.

## Step 3 — Author the state first; the sync is one-way

`emit-state` **never** infers completion from `status.md`. If a block closed, set its `status` to
`closed` in `tracks[].blocks[]` *before* running — that authored field is the input the derivation
reads. Skipping it leaves `focus` and every generated surface stale until someone reconciles by hand.

Do not hand-write anything `emit-state` owns: focus scalars, cache `synced_from` watermarks, tier
rollup tables, the HQ boards, master-plan wave tables, the lane JSONs. Editing those by hand
duplicates the derivation engine and drifts from it.

## Step 4 — Know the blast radius before you commit

**It regenerates the whole corpus spine, not the repo you ran it from.** One run has modified
`core/_planning/bastion/state.json`, `core/_planning/engine-rs/state.json`, `README.md`,
`client/_planning/brazilianportugui/status.md` and the tier/HQ rollups in a single pass —
several carrying **other sessions' uncommitted work**
(`bastion-web:emit-state-rewrites-sibling-repos`).

So: read `git status` afterwards, commit with a pathspec scoped to what you own, and leave the
rollups unstaged for whoever owns them. Never `git add -A` after this command.

## Step 5 — Read the run's warnings

- `I_EMIT_WROTE` — informational, one per surface written. This is your blast-radius list; read it.
- `W_EMIT_NO_SENTINEL` — a target has no `<!-- BEGIN generated:… -->` sentinel pair, so the emit was
  skipped. Most of these are long-standing (`master-plan.md` files fleet-wide). **Never hand-author
  a missing sentinel into prose** to make the warning go away — that is a separate fix to the target
  doc.

## Checklist

- [ ] `mev conformance --check toolchain-freshness` passes, or both binaries were reinstalled
- [ ] No measurement block is live
- [ ] Block statuses authored **before** the run, not after
- [ ] Blast radius read from the `I_EMIT_WROTE` lines
- [ ] Commit scoped by explicit pathspec; other lanes' files left alone
- [ ] Generated boards spot-checked — a format regression looks like a successful run
