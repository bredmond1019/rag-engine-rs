  Run a spec sequentially on one branch (or --worktree) with a per-task test→fix loop, one end review, a docs patch, and a PR
---

=============================================================================
 sdlc-flow — single-branch, single-review, PR-terminating SDLC engine
 =============================================================================

 The default engine for non-trivial feature work. Runs one spec's tasks
 SEQUENTIALLY on a SINGLE shared branch (so there are no inter-task merges to
 conflict — sdlc-block's #1 failure mode), with a per-task test→fix loop, ONE
 consolidated review at the end, a docs patch, and a PR as the terminal step.

 ISOLATION MODE
   Default: a plain branch (<spec>-flow) checked out IN THE MAIN WORKING TREE. No
   sparse-checkout worktree, so a relative planning/ symlink (brain-vaulted repos)
   stays intact. main is left on the branch until the PR merges.
   --worktree: the isolated sparse-checkout worktree under trees/<spec>-flow/ —
   opt in when you need true isolation (e.g. /sdlc-block fans out parallel children).

 A compact, COMMITTED, AUTHORITATIVE state.json + one worklog.md replace the 5×N
 per-stage report files: resume + review + wrap-up read a structured index instead
 of re-reading verbose prose. This inverts the harness's usual "committed report
 files are authoritative, state JSON is gitignored" rule on purpose (see D31).

 USAGE
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug>                  run every task in the spec, open a PR, stop
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug> 1-3              scope to a task range (1-3, 1,3,5, 5)
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug> --auto-merge     merge the PR + clean up on success
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug> --no-pr          stop after wrap-up; do not create a PR
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug> --worktree       run in an isolated worktree (default: plain branch)
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug> --resume         re-attach the branch/worktree, resume from state.json
   /sdlc-flow <spec-slug> --test-depth full  run the FULL gating suite per task (default: fast)

 PIPELINE
   worktree-setup → enumerate (D16 lint) → [resume load] → per-task loop
     → end-review → docs (gated on PASS) → wrap-up(PR)

   Per-task loop (sequential, on the one branch):
     implement → fast-test → (triage → fix/​bail) ×≤3
     One state-commit per task. A triage MAJOR / immediate-bail reason breaks
     straight to wrap-up (draft PR) — it does NOT burn three attempts.

   End-review: ONE review over the integrated tree, fed state.json as the index but
   reading `git diff <prBase>..HEAD` + tasks.md criteria directly + re-running the
   FULL gating suite (authoritative). PASS → docs; FAIL/PARTIAL → triage findings:
   small/localized → bounded fix→test→review (≤2, Opus last); broad → bail.

 COMMIT STRATEGY (crash recovery — everything lands on the branch)
   feat: implement <stem> task N      implement agent (per task)
   fix:  fix pass P for <stem> task N  fix agent (per pass)
   chore: flow state — <label>         state-writer (state.json + worklog.md + checkbox)
   docs: update docs for <spec>        docs agent
   chore: wrap up <spec>               wrap-up agent (status/log/amendment-log)

 MODEL TIERING (the token lever — see the MODEL map below)
   haiku : setup, enumerate, scout/state-load, test, state-writer
   sonnet: implement, fix, review, triage, docs, wrap-up
   opus  : ESCALATION on the FINAL per-task fix pass and the FINAL review attempt

 STATE  (committed — NOT gitignored — at planning/<spec>/sdlc/)
   sdlc-flow-state.json   the authoritative run index (per-task summary/issues/fixes/commit)
   worklog.md             the human-readable trail — one short section per task

## Antigravity Execution Guide

When the user asks you to run `/sdlc-flow <spec-slug> [range]`, do NOT run `sdlc-flow.js`. Instead, perform the flow execution yourself:

1. **Worktree Setup**:
   - Create (or re-attach) the one shared worktree at `trees/<spec-slug>-flow` and checkout branch `sdlc-flow/<spec-slug>`.
2. **Execute Tasks sequentially in the worktree**:
   - For each task in the specified range (or all if not specified):
     - Run `/update-task` to flip status to `In progress` in the worklog and local files.
     - Implement the task following instructions.
     - Run fast validation tests.
     - Fix failures (up to 3 triage/fix attempts).
     - Commit the task state on the branch (`feat: implement <slug> task N`).
3. **Consolidated End-Review**:
   - Once all tasks are complete, run the full validation/test suite.
   - Run the acceptance criteria check.
   - If PASS -> proceed to docs. If FAIL/PARTIAL -> run targeted fix loop.
4. **Docs & Wrap-up**:
   - If PASS, run `/update-docs --patch` to update documentation.
   - Update the status and log.
   - Create a pull request (PR) using git CLI or GitHub CLI (unless `--no-pr` is specified).
